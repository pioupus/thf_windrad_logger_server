his shorter one requires no temporary file, it is immune to multiple insertions, and it lets you change the schedule of an existing entry.

Say you have these:

croncmd="/home/me/myfunction myargs > /home/me/myfunction.log 2>&1"
cronjob="0 */15 * * * $croncmd"

To add it to the crontab, with no duplication:

( crontab -l | grep -v -F "$croncmd" ; echo "$cronjob" ) | crontab -

To remove it from the crontab whatever its current schedule:

( crontab -l | grep -v -F "$croncmd" ) | crontab -

Notes:

    grep -F matches the string literally, as we do not want to interpret it as a regular expression
    We also ignore the time scheduling and only look for the command. This way; the schedule can be changed without the risk of adding a new line to the crontab
